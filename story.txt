There once was a person who was trying to come up with a story, but he was frightfully
uncreative...

He tried to become more creative so he went to a shop for something called "creative potion", which was advertised to help people's creativity. He was convinced that he should be creative enough now and confidently went back home for continuing the story. 

After downing a double dose of the creative potion, the young man was ready to start his unimaginably creative story. So he got to writing. His pen flew accross the page without him even really thinking about what he was writing. After hours he sat back and admired his work.
